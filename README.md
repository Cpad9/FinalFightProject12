## Overview
This project provides a GUI to create a Hero and use him to battle
an array of user defined size of other Players. You have a selection of two
different attacks. You fight your way through enemies and after each fight you gain 100 health.
If you get to the end your name and final health are uploaded to a database


##Creating Hero
When Creating a hero you type in his name and pick a speciality(Wizard,Warrior,Rogue).
When you decide on your name and speciality you create him and it will be logged
into a database for tracking of all players and what their name and health is.

##Battling
Battling will consist of an array enemies of a size you pick. You must fight to win.
After winning or losing each battle you will be notified of your win/loss
Enemy attacks are selected randomly.

##Fighting
Wizards have good spells - Very useful against people with low resistance
Rogues are a mix of all - Vary your game play
Warriors have good physical attacks - Very useful against people with low armor

##Armor/Resistance
  Armor halves the damage done by physical attacks until armor is depleted
  Resistance fourths the damage done by spells until the resistance is depleted.



##DATABASE
  You can edit the database with the guidance of the code. You can DELETE,UPDATE,SELECT, and more
  with the help of the tool made.
